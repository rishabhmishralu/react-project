Most people forget how important sleep is for maintaining health and fitness. I am asked how to improve recovery but if you are not sleeping an average of 8 hours forget about other recovery aids. Switch off your phone, laptop, TV and hit the sack by 10 pm.

I will add quality protein to every meal. For non-vegetarians, they can add eggs, mutton, chicken, fish, for the vegetarians, paneer, tofu, soya can be an option.

I will stay away from unnecessary supplements which promise a lot but do not deliver. Though a quality whey protein shake is a good way to increase protein intake, especially for vegetarians. No, you do not need multi-vitamins, BCA or even pre-workout supplements. Even if I have visions of being the next Mr India, I will not ignore cardio. And no, lifting weights fast or just 4 minutes of extra hard HIIT is not cardio. At least 30 minutes of fast paced walking, easy paced jogging, cycling or swimming 3-5 days a week should be everybody’s goal.

That’s about it. No need to think up impossible goals which then are difficult to achieve. It is no wonder that gyms are full in the first week of January but will be emptier by the time June rolls in. Small victories add up over a period. Now go and do it." ></DataReuse>
